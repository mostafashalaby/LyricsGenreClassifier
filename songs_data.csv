Maren Morris,Circles Around This Town,country,"14 ContributorsCircles Around This Town Lyrics[Verse 1] I swear I don't know how I trusted A Montero with the AC busted A couple bad demos on a burned CD Would take me all the way to Tennessee I showed up to the new apartment First month's, last month's, two deposits Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet Thank God I was an optimist  [Chorus] I drove circles around this town Tryna write circles around this town Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin' Somethin' worth singin' about I've been kind and I've been ruthless Yeah, I got here, but the truth is Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different But I still got the pedal down Drivin' circles around this town  [Verse 2] So many times, I thought about lеavin' Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with Evеrybody else's ones that got away Hung around long enough to catch a break A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked Was the one about a car and the one about a church That I wrote See Maren Morris LiveGet tickets as low as $50You might also like[Chorus] Drivin' circles around this town Tryna write circles around this town Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin' Somethin' worth singin' about I've been kind and I've been ruthless Yeah, I got here, but the truth is Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different But I still got the pedal down Drivin' circles around this town Drivin' circles around this town Hey  [Instrumental Break]  [Chorus] I drove circles around this town Tryna write circles around this town Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin' Somethin' worth singin' about I've been kind and I've been ruthless Yeah, I got here, but the truth is Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different But I still got the pedal down I still get lost, I still get found Drivin' circles around this town [Outro] Oh, yeah1Embed"
Restless Road,Growing Old With You,country,"4 ContributorsGrowing Old With You Lyrics[Verse 1] Girl, you stole my heart And changed it Took all of my plans And rearranged them Now I finally know what amazing grace is When I look into your eyes Baby, I see my whole life  [Chorus] What you say we put us down some roots? Find a house up on the hill And travel 'round the world Put some pictures on the shelf Hold you close and keep the faith Raise some kids with our last name Well come on baby what you say we do? I feel like growing old with you Growing old with you  [Verse 2] Every day I love you better Than the day before Watching sunsets fading From the front porch We’ll build this home togеther Weather any storm And as thе years keep rolling on You'll be right where I belong You might also like[Chorus] What you say we put us down some roots? Find a house up on the hill And travel 'round the world Put some pictures on the shelf Hold you close and keep the faith Raise some kids with our last name Well come on baby what you say we do? I feel like growing old with you I’m growing old with you  [Chorus] What you say we put us down some roots? Find a house up on the hill Travel 'round this world Put some pictures on the shelf Maybe one day our babies go And have some babies of their own And you'll get all my time 'til all my time is through I feel like growing old with you Growing old with you I feel like growing old with youEmbed"
